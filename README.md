PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project involves developing an AI chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Jupyter Notebook. The chatbot is built using Python's NLTK library, which provides tools for processing human language data. The goal is to create an interactive chatbot capable of responding to user queries based on predefined patterns. The implementation begins with defining structured response patterns using the Chat class from the NLTK library. These response pairs consist of common user inputs such as greetings, questions, and requests for jokes, mapped to appropriate chatbot replies. To improve response efficiency, reflections are used to modify conversational input dynamically, enabling the chatbot to respond more naturally. Once the chatbot structure is set, a chat loop is created to facilitate continuous interaction. The chatbot receives user input, processes it, and generates an appropriate response based on the predefined patterns. The script also handles exit commands, allowing users to gracefully close the chat session when needed. By executing this project within Jupyter Notebook, the development process becomes highly interactive, allowing for real-time testing, debugging, and iterative improvements. The notebook environment enables structured documentation of code, making it easier to track changes and refine responses. Future enhancements could include integrating machine learning techniques for more adaptive responses or expanding the chatbotâ€™s capabilities with API-driven interactions. This project demonstrates the practical application of NLP for chatbot development, offering insights into conversational AI within a structured coding environment.

OUTPUT

AI Chatbot: Type 'exit' to stop. You: HELLO AI Chatbot: Hey there! You: HOW ARE YOU AI Chatbot: I'm just a chatbot, but I'm doing great! How about you? You: I AM FINE AI Chatbot: I didn't understand that. Try again! You: EXIT AI Chatbot: Goodbye!# -AI-CHATBOT-WITH-NLP
